## 📈 Educational Value
This project demonstrates several important statistical concepts:

1. Law of Large Numbers: Empirical probabilities converge to theoretical values as sample size increases
2. Probability Distributions: Understanding uniform (single die) and normal (multiple dice) distributions
3. Statistical Convergence: Visualizing how sample statistics approach population parameters
4. Monte Carlo Methods: Using random sampling to solve probabilistic problems

## 🚀 Quick Start
python
### Basic usage
```
simulator = DiceRollSimulator(dice_sides=6, num_dice=2)
rolls = simulator.roll_dice(num_rolls=1000)
```

### View statistics
``` stats = simulator.statistical_analysis(rolls) ```

### Generate visualizations
``` simulator.plot_distribution(rolls)```
